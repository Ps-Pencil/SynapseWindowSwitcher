Synapse is a quick launcher for ubuntu. The current stable release lacks a window switcher capability.

This serves as a workaround until they decided to add one.

Dependencies: xdotool

How to use:
- copy/symlink to somwhere in PATH. (Rename if you wish. I choose "we" just because it is faster to type).
- in synapse, type "we something" to switch to the window with name containing "something"
